/*
 * FeatureD, since we have variadic functions, nullary lambda abstractions
 * are supported for orthogonality reasons.
 * 
 * The example rewrites in the following manner:
 *      f (f f)
 *  ->  f (f 0)
 *  ->* f 1
 *  ->* 2
 *
 * These are probably pretty much unsafe since they always allow a 
 * combinator to rewrite but might turn out useful in cases.
