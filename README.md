The Egel Language
=================

The Egel language is a simple untyped algebraic toy language based on 
eager combinator rewriting.

The interpreter defined here is aimed at automating small 'mathematical'
tasks.

Disclaimer
----------

This is a hobby project, not the next big thing. The experiment is to
see how far one can push an eager combinator rewriting implementation in
idiomatic C++. Everything about the interpreter is experimental,
and the result will likely be a very, and I mean very, slow interpreter.
